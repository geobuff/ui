            &quot;GeoBuff is the single worst organization I have ever worked
            at. The snotty founders make me bring them lunch, they push poorly
            written code straight into production, and to be honest with you, I
            think they&apos;re using this thing as a front to launder Bitcoin. I
            haven&apos;t even seen them in 2 weeks! They just left with the
            company card and said they&apos;d be back once they&apos;ve finished
            with some R&D in Canc√∫n. They actually locked the front door when
            they left so if you&apos;re reading this please call the fire
            brigade.&quot;
